# MDHC

The MDHC program is a GUI implementation for the Mixed Density Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. Each step of the clustering process was deterministic, reproducible, and interpretable. The program integrates several well-known synthetic datasets and the Olivetti Face database, which can be run on any Microsoft Windows platform. Interested researchers can download and validate the performance on their own.
